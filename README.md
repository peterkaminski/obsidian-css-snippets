# Obsidian CSS Snippets

## Overview

These are CSS snippets I use for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

* peterkaminski-fonts.css - better fonts (current version may be Mac-specific)
* peterkaminski-preview-width.css - remove fixed line width for preview mode

## Usage

To use snippet files, put them in a directory called `(your-vault)/.obsidian/snippets`, then enable them in Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets.

(For reference, see: [Use Themes and/or CSS snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles) in Obsidian Help.)

Once they're on your system, you can customize them to your preference.

If you have enhancements you would like to share back, issues, comments, and pull requests are welcome.

If you have multiple vaults, and the filesystem your vaults are stored on supports it, you may wish to create one `snippets` folder, and then hard-link that folder in each of your `.obsidian` directories, so you only need to maintain the snippets in one place.
